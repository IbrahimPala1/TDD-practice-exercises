Simple exercises to work on TDD Process. 

Key concepts -
- Red, green, refactor phase
- Regular commits 
- Regular testing
- Gain proper understaning of task from client 


Things to do

learn about rgr cycle 
Watch external reviews in hub
make a list of step by step tdd
find out about apis 
find out about node js
read a little on react
find a little about react native
polymorphism
complete challamges


1- gain understanding of client requirment- (input, output table, any punctuation?, any integars?, what if input is blank?, should it return errors?)
2- write first simple test
3- fail test 
4 write simple code
4- make test pass 
5- refactor to make it look better 
 ---- 1- first time hard code it and pass the test
 ---- 2- test the same thing again but this time add an if statement
 ---- 3 extend if statement 
 ---- 4 then refactor code to have a general rule
6- commit to github (after every test passes)
7- repeat steps 2-6 until code works fully. 
Note - in javascript use camleCase. Keep names user friendly. Read error messages.
