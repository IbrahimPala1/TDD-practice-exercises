school report 
how students did in tests 
get a string of coommar seperated values containing test results from schools

build a simple report

"Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red" => "Green: 2\nAmber: 1\nRed: 2"

no empty string return no results given

As a school
so that i can see the results of the students in an report 
i would like to see a list of the grades
